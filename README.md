# Boston_Airbnb
Analysis of the Boston Airbnb Dataset of Kaggle for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree

## Project Description
The Jupyter Notebook is the result of the first Data Science project of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. It is based on Airbnb data available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston?select=listings.csv.
Three questions were answered using the dataset:
1. How long do people rent homes in Boston? 
2. What makes a successfull desription of an advertised home?
3. What are the features, that influence the price the most?  
In order to do that descriptive statistics and visualisations were used, as well as machine learning methods.

## Files Used
Two files of the Boston Airbnb Dataset were used: the calendar.csv and the listings.csv. The first file includes the data for each home from 2016-09-06 to 2017-09-05. It shows if a home was rented and if not how much it would have cost. In the listings.csv the listing of each home is displayed with varios informations such as number of beds, location, etc.

## Libraries
numpy == 1.21.5
pandas == 1.4.2
matplotlib == 3.5.1
wordcloud == 1.8.2.2
nltk == 3.7
sklearn == 1.0.2
ishap = 0.41.0
yellowbrick == 1.5

## Summary of the results
We saw that most people only spend a few days in the houses, and that some houses were rented out all year round. We have shown that the use of some descriptive adjectives seems to help attract people. And finally, we have seen that houses that can be rented out completely are more expensive. All this news may not seem surprising. Nevertheless, you should always rely on data and not just on what your gut tells you.
